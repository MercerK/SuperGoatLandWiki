# Super GoatLand

Welcome to Super GoatLand! We are a small whitelisted server and currently accepting players age 18 or older. We do make the occasional exception, but our overall objective is to provide a friendly and mature community for all players. This SMP server with plugins focused on enhancing the vanilla experience in a balanced way (not McMMO balanced). We also host our fair share of community events!

The server address (server IP) is `mc.supergoat.land`. It is a whitelisted server, so you will not be able to join until your application is approved.

The server is located in US East Coast and majority of our community is within the East Coast. Thus, upcoming community events and giveaway/contests will be tailored to that.

To join, you'll need to join our discord at https://discord.gg/wrWc97g and submit an application in the #apply channel.

When submitting an application, please answer the following:

1. Your age.
2. Your in game name (IGN).
3. What are you looking for on a Minecraft server?
4. Tell us a bit about yourself.
5. Are you allowed to grief?
6. Is PvP allowed?
7. Where did you hear about us?

**Note:** *Lying about your age will result in a permanent ban.*
