# Config

1. The nether portal search range has been decreased to 32 blocks, from 128. This is to minimize problems between
   multiple players, however, this can have a side effect. When you notice the portal is constantly recreating, this is
   an indication that the portal is not able to build in the target location to link properly. You'll need to use a
   [Nether Portal Calc](https://maximumfx.nl/portal/en/) to map the portals correctly or reach out to a staff member.

## Vaal Orb

<img src="/assets/items/vaal-orb.png" />

Imagine an item from Path of Exile called Vaal Orb and introduce it into Minecraft. What would this item do? Well, it'll
corrupt your item giving it a chance to improve it or make it worse. Maybe you can get an efficiency 6 or 7 item...

- **Note**: Items that become corrupted can no longer be modified.
- **Note**: Mob drop only.

# Custom Recipes

## Cobwebs

- 9 string to 1 cobweb.

## Diamond Shards

- Diamond shards are used for trading with other players.

# Prevent-Mine Command

With 1.17, they introduced Budding Amethyst. These blocks cannot be silk touched and you can accidentally destroy them,
which feels bad. However, using `/prevent-mine BUDDING_AMETHYST`, you can prevent yourself from mining those blocks for
the next 5 minutes. This can be used for all sorts of blocks.

# PvP Mechanic

We are a PvE first server, with PvP on a consent basis. However, we know players do enjoy the regular PvP as well as
head drops.

If you wish to engage with PvP with others (such as similar to PvP servers), you can toggle `/pvp`. You will then be
flagged for PvP, which will display next to your name. Players that have the `/pvp` flag enabled will drop their head
upon death.

Non-PvP-Flagged players can engage in combat with other PvP players, however they will automatically be flagged as a
result. If they die, they will drop their head.

However, to prevent abuse, there is a 30 minute cooldown associated to disabling the PvP flag (once enabled) and it
automatically refreshes when you attack a player.

# Zombie Flesh Mechanic

Eating zombie flesh can be a bit boring, so we decided to spice it up! When there are multiple players on, you can eat a
raw piece of zombie and there may be a chance that it'll trigger a random event. That event may reward or punish a
random player on the server.
