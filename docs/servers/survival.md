# Config

1. The nether portal search range has been decreased to 32 blocks, from 128. This is to minimize problems between
   multiple players, however, this can have a side effect. When you notice the portal is constantly recreating, this is
   an indication that the portal is not able to build in the target location to link properly. You'll need to use a
   [Nether Portal Calc](https://maximumfx.nl/portal/en/) to map the portals correctly or reach out to a staff member.

Imagine an item from Path of Exile called Vaal Orb and introduce it into Minecraft. What would this item do? Well, it'll
corrupt your item giving it a chance to improve it or make it worse. Maybe you can get an efficiency 6 or 7 item...
