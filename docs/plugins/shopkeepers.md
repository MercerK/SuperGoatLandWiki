# Shopkeepers

You can open up a player shop by buying a Shopkeeper at spawn (6 diamonds). There are a few items to note before you put one down. 

* You'll most likely want to change the shop type. To do so, you'll need to hold the egg in your hand and left click the air (look up). This cycles the shop type. I recommend "Trade shop" to allow trading of items. "Buy shop" allows you to buy items, sell shop allows you to sell items for emeralds.

* Once you selected a shop, you'll want to put down a chest (this is the inventory), select the chest by SNEAK-RIGHT_CLICK on the chest, and then SNEAK-RIGHT_CLICK on a block. This will place a shopkeeper and associate it to the chest.

* You'll need to put items in the chest first (what you want to sell/buy/trade). You can then SNEAK-RIGHT_CLICK on the villager to edit the prices and customizations of the villager. To set a price in a "Trade Shop", drag an item to first (or second) "slot" beneath the item. 

* Once you do all that, you should be able to see the trades.

* If you delete the shopkeeper, you lose the egg altogether (intentional), so please place the shopkeeper in a location you'll want to use. As it is a new plugin, an admin or staff member can help out. We don't want to make it a punishment due to a lack of understanding, however, we want to provide a currency dump in the server.
