# Deathchest

- You can see your deathchests by running /dc list
- You can only have 10 death chests. Make sure to go through and clear out old death chests. A death chest will only
  last for an hour until it expires. After an hour, items will drop.
- There is a known bug where a "death chest" would get destroyed. Don't worry. You can try placing a chest where it may
  of been destroyed and it may restore it. If that does not work, reach out to a staff member.
