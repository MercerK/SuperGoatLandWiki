# Plugins

Super GoatLand uses plugins to enhance and improve the survival multiplayer experience. These are some of the key ones to be aware of:

* Blocklocker. Allows the player to protect chests/doors with a sign.
* Death Chests. When you die, your items go into a death chest. This is locked to you and no one else.
* Dynmap. A web interface of the currently explored world: http://147.135.31.83:8123/
* Essentials. Provides 1  home. This is the only source of command teleportation.
* Lands. Players can claim their land. This is completely optional, as our community does not grief/steal.
* Harbor. A balanced mechanism to support multiple players sleeping, instead of the entire server.
* Mythical Trinkets. Custom items.
* Portals. Allows us to setup waypoints between fixed locations. 
* Shopkeeper. Players can buy a shopkeeper, which allows for item trading.

There are more plugins, however, those are used for server administration, moderation, or other related functions.
