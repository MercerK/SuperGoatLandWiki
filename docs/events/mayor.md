# Mayor Event [08/01/2021 to 08/31/2021]

Citizens of Goat Land!

We have a brand new spawn area and town hall (thank you Galaxy!!!), but our new town hall is... unoccupied. There is
nothing sadder than a beautiful town hall with no one working in it.

Who works in a town hall? Why the Mayor, of course! So we need a MAYOR! Yes! A Mayor of Super Goat Land!

What would a Super Goat Land Mayor do? Well, you tell us. If you want to be Mayor, campaign and tell us what you'd do.
What rules would you enact? Make some campaign promises and sell your ideas to your fellow Goats! Let the Goatlandians
decide!

Yes, my fellow Goatlandians, YOU get to pick the Mayor, and by picking a Mayor, you decide what a Mayor does.

To run for Mayor, simply... run for Mayor. Campaign across the server in whatever way you think is most effective.
_Please don't be obnoxious to other players while campaigning. We're adults. We leave it to you to figure out where the
line is, but please don't spam chat and Discord constantly. That's probably not going to win you votes, and SPF and Merc
don't want to have to step in if it gets out of hand. This should be fun... not annoying._

Tell Goat Land what you'd do as Mayor. Tell us why we should pick you. Have fun and be creative!

Our election season will last a month. You may campaign between now and August 31st. On September 1st, Merc and SPF will
count the votes. How do you vote? Simply place a sign on a mailbox in the Town Hall (there are signs directing you to
the mail room inside) to claim a mailbox. You'll be putting your vote in your mailbox in a couple of weeks. We'll let
you know when you can vote and what you need to do to vote soon.

# As Mayor

You'll work in partnership with the server staff. You don't need to be staff to be Mayor, and you don't become staff
when you become Mayor.

You can ask the server admin for assistance with enacting some changes to the server, but Merc and SPF are still the
owners/operators of the server and have the right to set limits. After all, there are some things that are just
impossible for us to do and some basic things we're not going to change (e.g., we're not going to change the age limit
of the server or wipe out all player progress on the server). We don't have many limits like that, but feel free to run
things by us if you're concerned. We can't give you a list of restrictions because we can't possibly come up with every
idea people might come up with. It's easier if you ask.

## Other

1. **How long do you stay as mayor?**
