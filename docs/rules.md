# General Rules
At the end of the day, you should be a mature adult that is able to operate within an environment without causing trouble.
If that is too much for you, then you most likely will not be a good fit.

1. Listen and respect staff.
- Do not argue/debate with staff.
- Do not whine about warnings/infractions/bans/etc.
+ To discuss appeals, submit a ticket.

2. When discussing topics, please be mindful of the audience and those listening.
To be safe, we don't recommend discussing about the following:
Politics, Religion, Drugs, Pornography, or other mature topics.

3. No advertising or promotion (either via the server or DMs),
without explicit approval from the Admirals (owners).

4. Golden Rule - If you are unsure whether an action is permitted,
please consult the staff team for guidance.

5. Don't ping or DM staff directly. If you need assistance,
you can ask the community in #help or submit a ticket for staff assistance.

6. No harassment, bullying, hate speech or verbal abuse.

7. English only.

# Minecraft Rules
1. Griefing
- Do not modify an existing player's build, unless approved by the player.
- Do not build 1x1 towers without the intent to remove them.
- Do not grief the world (this includes chickens).
- Do not steal.

2. Guidelines
- Please help us preserve the world. For example:
  - When cutting down trees, chop down the entire tree.
  - When creeper explosions happen, make an effort to restore the damage.

3. No unauthorized modifications & cheating
- No flying, unless approved by an admin.
- No X-Ray.
- Do not exploit mechanics introduced with paper, plugins, or customizations, unless approved by an admin.
  - Report any that you find.
- Do not use a plugin for unintended usages, including client side mods.
- Do not share the world seed or use tools to exploit information based on the world seed.
- Bypassing anti-AFK is a bannable offense.

4. Technical Builds

- We do support the use of vanilla technical builds, but please keep the following in mind:
  - This is a Paper server, with plugins. Some mechanics may be different from vanilla.

- Not Allowed:
  - Duping (TNT duping for mining is okay though)
  - Flying machines with the intent of bypassing protection.

- Design Guidelines:
  - Aim for lag friendly designs. Minimize light updates. Don't have unnecessary minecarts.
  - Hopper optimization (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxaIIwdVm4)
  - Use on/off toggle switches.
  - For solutions catching endless amount of items, incorporate automation to:
    - Destroy overflowing items
    - Stop the contraption when storage is full.

5. Respect the boundaries of other players and their builds.

6. PvE server, with PvP only on a consent basis.

7. Since we are a small server, the max community/group will be 5 players unless approved by staff. As the server grows, we will either increase the number or drop the limit altogether. We want to encourage folks to build communities, versus everyone joining one and overpowering both individual players and small communities.

8. Trade Sniping will not be tolerated.
