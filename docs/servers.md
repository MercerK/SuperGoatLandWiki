# Servers

We host a few servers for the community! Our primary being the survival world and occassionally, we'll bring up
additional game servers to play other games together.

**Note**: We use Bluemap as our choice of mapping technology for minecraft servers. If you notice any slowness, consider
enabling hardware acceleration for that browser.
